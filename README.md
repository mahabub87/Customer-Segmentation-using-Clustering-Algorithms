This study demonstrates the application of clustering algorithms to segment customers
based on their demographics and spending behavior. Using a dataset of 10 customer
records containing attributes such as gender, age, annual income, and spending score, we
apply K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering to identify distinct customer groups. The
Elbow Method is used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and the resulting
segments are analyzed to provide actionable business insights. Findings show that even
with a small dataset, clustering effectively reveals patterns in spending and income that
can guide targeted marketing strategies.
